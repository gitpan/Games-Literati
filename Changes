	- Replace hardcoded "Scrabble/Literati" printed title with our $GameName-dependent text
	- Sprinkle comments throughout the code, to help me understand and debug it better
	- Update/expand POD documentation
	- BUGFIX: change the "cross-word" scoring (if you lay down a horizontal set of tiles, 
	  the "cross-words" are any vertical words that are created) to check the wilds under 
	  new tiles in the cross-word don't get scored, but that new tiles that are part of the 
	  cross-word are scored (and include bonuses) = fixed the array indexing in the unless 
	  (wild), and fixed the logic so if it's not wild, it does score.

	- Fix scoring bug -- wilds weren't getting rotated when the rest of the board was, so 
	  for Y-axis words, it was scoring too much if there was a wild already on the board as 
	  part of the new word.  (Found while playing Words With Friends: real game scored 2 
	  points less than Games::Literati::wordswithfriends() because a two-point letter was 
	  really a wild, but G::L::wwf didn't notice.)  FIX = Swap row/col during wilds 
	  comparison.
